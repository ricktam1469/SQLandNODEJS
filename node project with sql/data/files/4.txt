group by restriction
1>either only colms, or anly aggregate
2>all colms in group by only comes with select parameters.Only aggregate can come any numbers

where have to come before groupby, hence we use having clause...

Insert into t1(Name,id)
select name, color
from t2


Trunctate table t1
In truncate id get reset.
In delete id doesnt get reset

IS NULL and ISNULL difference

mysql> alter table t1
    -> add constraint age default(0) for eid;

Inner Join-It is exclusive(not giving row where it dont matches
select * from t1 join(by default inner) t2
on t1.id=t2.id;

Left Join- left join table will definitely come, it will null if not available(first run inner join then do next)
Right Join-right join will come for sure
Full Join
Cross Join-cartisian product

t1,t2 where t1.id=t2.t1.id-----from t1 join t2 on t1.id=t2.t1.id
*= for left join
=* for right join


	
What will be the opposite of inner join?
An OUTER join, which can be of three options:

LEFT
RIGHT
FULL


Using LEFT JOIN/IS NULL

   SELECT p.*
     FROM PERSON p
LEFT JOIN ADDRESS a ON a.addrid = p.addrid
    WHERE a.addrid IS NULL
Using NOT EXISTS

SELECT p.*
  FROM PERSON p
 WHERE NOT EXISTS(SELECT NULL
                    FROM ADDRESS a
                   WHERE a.addrid = p.addrid)
Using NOT IN

SELECT p.*
  FROM PERSON p
 WHERE p.addrid NOT IN (SELECT a.addrid
                          FROM ADDRESS a)

In union null = null
distinct by default

IN is used for multiple records
